# PortfolioDeux
The second iteration of my Portfolio of work <br>
https://turtle-head.github.io/PortfolioDeux/ <br>
<br>
This site displays a list of the programming languages I am comfortable using as well as contains some visual demonstrations of sites I have made and inks to my original portfolio written in Knockout that allows a user to explore my codebase for each piece of work I have completed for your viewing pleasure. <br>
<br>
The site also has a contact form that users can use to connect with me for social and work purposes. <br>
<br>
The site has drop-down menus that link to my projects from which you can check the code as well as website links to allow the exploration of my work. <br>
<br>
Best regards, <br>
James Fehr <br>
